						<p style="font-family: Galanomedium"> On arriving in Athens, you start the city sightseeing driving past the Temple of Zeus, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, guarded by the “evzones” dressed in their traditional costume, the Parliament and the Panathinaikon Stadium where the first Olympics of modern times were held in 1896. The whole stadium is built of pure white marble. Our tour continues by the Library – the Academy – the University, three buildings representing 19th Century architecture blended with the classical influence. The tour then passes by Omonia Square, the commercial centre of the city and Syntagma Square, which is the business and cultural centre. Your Athens’ city sightseeing ends at a leading café at the foot of the Acropolis, from where you can view all the majestic monuments of the amazing Acropolis while enjoying your refreshment. The tour continues to the old part of the city called Plaka where you can explore its mainly pedestrian streets with picturesque houses, shops and numerous cafés. After the free time in Plaka you will board your coach for the return journey to Piraeus port.
							</br></br>
                            The new Acropolis Museum is housed in a state-of-the-art building designed by Swiss-born architect Bernard Tschumi. With an area of 226,000 square feet - 10 times larger than the old museum - the new building feels open and full of light. Its design has received mixed reviews from locals, but there is no doubt it is a striking and highly functional work of architecture.
								</br></br>
                            The Acropolis Museum houses all the portable objects removed from the Acropolis since 1834, except of a few bronzes displayed in the National Archeological Museum and inscriptions in the Epigraphical Museum. The museum's artifacts are primarily religious in nature, including a fascinating collection of ancient statues used in religious ceremonies, and they provide a fascinating visual history of Greek religion. </p>

						<h5 class="mt-0 mavibaslik">Sounion Ancient Temple Of  Poseidon And Cope Sounion</h5>
						<p style="font-family: Galanomedium">The 1 hour and 30 minutes trip is enchanting, with images full of nature, the sea and pine-trees. The Temple of Poseidon awaits you, dedicated to the god of the sea. This is the southernmost and highest point of the cape and the monument looks like it is washed by the Aegean on all sides.
						
						</br></br>
                            The construction of the Temple was initially commenced at the beginning of the 5th century B.C. Yet, it was destroyed by the Persians during the Persian Wars and so the Athenians built, in 444 B.C., the newer Temple, parts of which are preserved until today. The Temple is of Doric order and bore a frieze with relief decoration while it was also adorned by immense statues called Kouroi.
						</br></br>
                            The archaeological site of Sounion, apart from the Sanctuaries of Poseidon and Athena, includes the fortress, a small settlement from the Hellenistic era, the propylaea (entrance gateway) and the porticoes.</p>

						<h5 class="mt-0 mavibaslik">Akrotiri Village Excavations</h5>
							<p style="font-family: Galanomedium">The people who lived on prehistoric Santorini called the island “Strongyle” (round). In 1650 BC the massive Thira volcano erupted, sinking the center of Strongyle and leaving behind an incredible caldera. You will marvel at its towering cliffs as tender boats convey you to the port at Athinios, where our airconditioned bus waits to take you to Santorini’s most significant archeological site, the village of Akrotiri.
											</br></br>
                                From Athinios we will drive south. We will stop at the ruins of the island’s famous windmill for photos, and to enjoy the incredible panoramic view. We leave the windmill for Akrotiri, where you’ll have a chance to explore this ancient village – its amazing ruins will take you back in time. These advanced people built two- and three-storey homes and grew crops, and you will marvel at the remnants of the houses, shops and workshops that surrounded the village square thousands of years ago. Akrotiri had been a bustling town, but its inhabitants abandoned it before the Thira eruption, a mystery archeologists and historians are still trying to solve. The ash from the volcano buried the city, preserving many of its structures and some of its incredible frescoes. Could Akrotiri be the lost city of Atlantis? We’ll let you decide.
								</br></br>
                                After Akrotiri we’ll drive to Fira, the capital of Santorini and its largest town, where we’ll visit the Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral, also known as the Church of Ypapantis, famed for its elegant construction and its beautiful frescoes, which were painted by Santorini artist Christoforos Assimis. After our visit to the cathedral, you can linger in Fira to shop and enjoy a coffee or a snack, or you can take the Santorini Cable Car, the teleferik to the port below, an incredible descent of more than 200 meters toward the deep blue waters of the caldera. Our tender boats will be ready, once you disembark from the teleferik, to bring you back to the ship.

							<p style="font-family: Galanomedium">Drive along the picturesque south-eastern coastline, dotted with white-washed villages, to Lindos, one of the most important of the three great cities of ancient times. See how this entire city is guarded by medieval walls which were constructed by the knights of St. John in the 13th Century. Within them stands the ancient Acropolis of Lindos, on the brink of a precipice 122 m above the sea. From the Acropolis, marvel at the breathtaking views covering the great expanse of the Aegean Sea and St. Paul’s Bay, where the apostle cast anchor during his historic voyage to Ephesus. Proceed on foot uphill, to the great staircase leading from the Hellenistic Portico to the Acropolis and Temple of Athena. Should you wish to make your way up by mule, a fee must be paid to the local muleteer. After the guided tour of the Acropolis, enjoy some free time on your own in Lindos village before meeting up with your motor coach. Return to Rhodes city and enjoy a panoramic drive through the new part of the city before continuing to Mount Smith to see the ruins of ancient Rhodes, the Temple of Apollo and Diagoras Stadium. Afterwards your motor coach will drop you off at Porte d’Amboise, the start of the walking tour through the medieval city of Rhodes. Follow your guide through the northern part where once lived the knights and their attendants. View the Palace of the Knights, continue your walk down Chevaliers Road to the Marine Gate and return to the ship. A short visit to a ceramic factory is included.

                                Drive along the medieval walls to the summit of Mount Smith, the Acropolis of ancient Rhodes. From the tumbled massive pillars of the Temple of Athena, the view encompasses the nearby Temple of Apollo, the stadium of Diagoras and the port, once protected by the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. The drive continues across the island to Philerimos. The summit of Philerimos was the site of Ialysos, one of the three ancient cities of Rhodes. Later sites include the restored Byzantine Church of Our Lady of Philerimos, a chapel with 15th Century frescoes, and the ruined Castle of the Knights. After the visit and some free time, return to Rhodes and begin a guided walk of the old walled city to the Porte d’Amboise. It is a pleasure to stroll the street of the Knights with its medieval buildings, winding alleys, towers, turrets and emblazoned façades. You will then visit the impressive Grand Master’s Palace and have the chance to see the superb mosaics. The pleasant walk passes through the Marine Gate before you return to the ship.
